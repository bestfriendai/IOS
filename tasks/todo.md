# Stream Persistence with Supabase Implementation Plan

## Analysis
The app currently has comprehensive Stream and User models with SwiftData, but lacks cloud synchronization. I need to implement a complete stream persistence system using Supabase that provides:
- Real-time synchronization across devices
- Offline functionality with conflict resolution
- User session management
- Stream metadata persistence with all existing properties
- Secure data encryption

## Task List

### 1. Create SupabaseService Core Foundation
- [ ] Create SupabaseService.swift with authentication and database operations
- [ ] Add Supabase client configuration and initialization
- [ ] Implement session management with Supabase Auth
- [ ] Add proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Create connection monitoring and health checks

### 2. Implement Stream CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create database schema mapping for Stream model
- [ ] Implement stream creation, reading, updating, deletion
- [ ] Add stream metadata persistence (position, quality, preferences)
- [ ] Handle stream ownership and user relationships
- [ ] Add batch operations for multiple streams

### 3. Create Real-time Synchronization System
- [ ] Create StreamSyncManager.swift for real-time sync
- [ ] Implement Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] Handle real-time updates and notifications
- [ ] Create sync status tracking and indicators

### 4. Implement Offline/Online Data Sync
- [ ] Create offline data caching strategy
- [ ] Implement sync queue for offline operations
- [ ] Add conflict detection and resolution algorithms
- [ ] Handle data consistency during sync
- [ ] Add sync progress tracking and user feedback

### 5. Create SyncModels for Database Schema
- [ ] Create SyncModels.swift with database representations
- [ ] Add transformation between local and remote models
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Create schema versioning and migration support

### 6. Integrate with Existing Stream Management
- [ ] Update Stream.swift to support sync operations
- [ ] Add sync status tracking to Stream model
- [ ] Implement automatic sync triggers
- [ ] Create sync conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Add sync settings and preferences

### 7. Update ContentView with Sync Integration
- [ ] Add sync status indicators to UI
- [ ] Implement sync triggers and background operations
- [ ] Add offline mode indicators
- [ ] Create sync error handling and user notifications
- [ ] Add sync settings and controls

### 8. Create Backup and Restore System
- [ ] Implement full data backup to Supabase
- [ ] Add incremental backup capabilities
- [ ] Create restore functionality with conflict resolution
- [ ] Add data export and import features
- [ ] Implement cross-device data migration

### 9. Add Security and Encryption
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Add secure API key management
- [ ] Create user-specific data isolation
- [ ] Add security audit logging
- [ ] Implement data anonymization features

### 10. Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Test real-time sync across multiple devices
- [ ] Test offline functionality and sync resolution
- [ ] Optimize sync performance and battery usage
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] Test data migration and backup/restore

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **streams**: Main stream data with all properties from Stream model
- **stream_positions**: Stream layout positions and UI state
- **stream_metadata**: Extended metadata and user preferences
- **sync_operations**: Pending operations queue
- **conflict_resolutions**: Conflict resolution history

### Key Features
- **Real-time Sync**: Instant updates across all devices
- **Offline First**: Full functionality without internet
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging of concurrent edits
- **Data Encryption**: Secure storage of sensitive information
- **Cross-device**: Seamless experience across iOS devices
- **Backup/Restore**: Complete data protection and recovery

### Architecture
- **SupabaseService**: Core database and auth operations
- **StreamSyncManager**: Real-time sync and conflict resolution
- **OfflineManager**: Offline data management and sync queue
- **EncryptionService**: Data encryption and security
- **SyncModels**: Database schema and transformations
